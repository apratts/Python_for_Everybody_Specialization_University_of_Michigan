# Python_for_Everybody_Specialization_University_of_Michigan
This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, I’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create my own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization. There are 5 courses in the Specialization with projects designed to help me practice and apply the skills I learn.
# Course 1: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. It covers the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  Once I completes this course, I will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3. There are 7 weeks in the course, with numerous vidoes, readings, quizzes, and Python programming exercises that are peer reviewed.

# Week 3 - Chapter One - Why We Program (continued)
Week 3 concludes chapter one, has four videos, one quiz, and one short assignment.
